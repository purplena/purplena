Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Lena**. My favorite color is purple.
That's how Purplena appeared.

I live in a sunny and warm place in the South of **France**, next to Mediterranean Sea :ocean:. When I look through my window, I see a majestic mountain Canigou :mount_fuji: that I will hike one day. 

Here is my âœ¨special repositoryâœ¨

Starting from **September 2022**, I am studying programming on an everyday basis. I have already had some basic knowledge but this time I am doing everything properly and methodically.  
So far I have finished the following courses: 
-	[**HTML&CSS Tutorial and Projects Course 2022 (Flexbox&Grid)**](https://www.udemy.com/course/in-depth-html-css-course-build-responsive-websites/?referralCode=40C89DF13A25C5EC2CCF) by [John Smilga](https://github.com/john-smilga) on [udemy.com](https://www.udemy.com/)
-	[**The PHP Practitioner**](https://laracasts.com/series/php-for-beginners) by [Jeffrey Way](https://github.com/JeffreyWay) on [laracasts.com](https://laracasts.com/)
- [**Git Me Some Version Control**](https://laracasts.com/series/git-me-some-version-control) by [Jeffrey Way](https://github.com/JeffreyWay) on [laracasts.com](https://laracasts.com/)
- [**MySQL Database Design**](https://laracasts.com/series/mysql-database-design) by [Jeffrey Way](https://github.com/JeffreyWay) on [laracasts.com](https://laracasts.com/)

I think I found my two mentors. Jeffrey and John are extremely talented professors.

Also I took some small courses on **SASS** and development with **Vite**. 

I am currently learning [**Object-Oriented Programming**](https://laracasts.com/series/object-oriented-principles-in-php) with Jeffrey Way. The goal for the next months is to be familiar with Laravel framework with the help of Laracasts tutorials. 
Later I would like to finish **JavaScript** tutorial. And the final destination is **React**.

I can speak **English**, **French** and **Russian**.
