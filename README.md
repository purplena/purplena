Hi there 👋

My name is **Lena**. My favorite color is purple.
That's how Purplena appeared.

I live in a sunny and warm place in the South of **France**, next to Mediterranean Sea :ocean:. When I look through my window, I see a majestic mountain Canigou :mount_fuji: that I will hike one day. 

Here is my ✨special repository✨

I started my programming journey in **September 2022**. I have already had some basic knowledge but this time I am doing everything methodically.  
So far I have finished the following courses on-line:

I think I found my two mentors. Jeffrey and John are extremely talented professors.

Also I took some small courses on **SASS** and development with **Vite** and **Webpack**. 

Currently I enrolled to the program **"Web and Mobile Development"** in French school of Art&Design called [**IDEM**](https://lidem.eu/), April 2023 - January 2024. 
I also continue my personam training at home. I am concentrated on learning **JavaScript** and **React**.

I can speak **English**, **French** and **Russian**.
